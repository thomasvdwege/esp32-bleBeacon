# bleBeacon
ESP32 Beacon that currently broadcasts an Eddystone URL. iBeacon functionality still needs to be build.
Code is written in C++, thanks to [nkolban](https://github.com/nkolban) for providing C++ libraries for the ESP32 api.

## Requirements
To build this app you'll need the standard ESP32 build environment, and the C++ libraries for the BLE api
* [esp-idf](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf)
* [nkolban C++ utils for ESP32](https://github.com/nkolban/esp32-snippets/tree/master/cpp_utils)
